        <p>The most effective way to preserve the life of your vehicle without spending a ton of money is to get your oil and oil filter changed regularly and many people are guilty of putting off oil changes, but clean oil and oil filters are essential in maintaining a healthy engine. Oil lubricates the multitude of moving parts within your engine, allowing it to run smoothly. Over time, oil breaks down and becomes gummy or watery, and doesn’t work as well. If left unchanged, old oil can cause expensive and inconvenient engine problems.</p>
<h5>How Regular Oil Changes Benefit Your Vehicle</h5>
<p>
Oil helps lubricate and cool the various parts of your engine, while reducing friction, diminishing wear, and forming a seal between the pistons, rings, and cylinder walls. Without the cleaning power of new oil, carbon and particle buildup become toxic to the engine. This is why we recommend that you follow the interval as suggested by your most recent oil change (the earlier of the two limits from the sticker on your windshield). Getting regular oil and filter changes is a small price to pay to avoid expensive engine repair or breakdown.</p>
<h5>Benefits of oil changes include:</h5>
<ul class="list_style_ul_children px-0">
<li><strong>Improves gas mileage –</strong> replacing dirty oil reduces friction, meaning there is less resistance while driving, allowing you to get a few extra miles</li>
<li><strong>Reduces emissions –</strong> contribute positively to climate change by reducing pollution through regular oil change as clean oil doesn’t burn.</li>
<li><strong>Prevent sludge build-up –</strong> clean oil and oil filters keep your engine running smoothly and efficiently. There is an accumulation of dirt particles and debris as oil runs through your engine and even the presence of an oil filter will not hinder the dirt from seeping through.</li>
<li><strong>Improved performance –</strong> a well-lubricated engine allows you to experience a smooth ride while driving and reduces friction.</li>
<li><strong>Preserves engine life –</strong> maintaining a well-lubricated, cleanly filtered engine will ensure that you get the most out of your vehicle from gas mileage and performance to longevity of life</li>
