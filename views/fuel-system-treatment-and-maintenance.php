       <p>The right fuel system cleaning can do wonders for your vehicleâ€™s performance. Dirty fuel systems lead to sluggish cars, dirty spark plugs, and low fuel mileage. Injectors spray fuel through a nozzle into the combustion chamber. Ideally, they spray a fine, cone-shaped mist. But deposits and wear can cause them to spray inefficient streams of fuel into the chamber. These streams burn poorly and can cause hesitation and other performance problems. Fuel injection cleaning involves removing deposits from the injectors and fuel lines, and adding a clean fuel filter to the vehicle. Dirty fuel and inefficient fuel systems also can lead to more expensive repairs. One of the major causes of premature catalytic converter failure is improper fuel burning. A new catalytic converter can cost thousands. But a bit of preventative maintenance can help you avoid these kinds of costly repairs and system replacements.</p>
