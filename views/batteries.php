Always double check your battery to make sure that it is properly secured in the vehicle and that all cables and terminals are clean and tightly connected. A battery may still have life left to give if it stopped working because of a weak connection</p>
<h5>Weakened or dead battery warning signs</h5>
<p>

Most modern batteries have evolved and have been designed to work at full capacity until its usefulness is exhausted. However, batteries today function much longer than they used to and smaller signs must be looked out for and they include:
 
        </p>
        
<ul class="list_style_ul_children">
    <li>
-	Diminished electric functions (dimmed headlights, slower power windows, etc.)</li>
<li>
-	Old age</li>
<li>
-	Clicking noise when turning the key</li>
<li>
-	Corroded terminalss</li>
<li>
-	Slower engine crank</li>
</ul>

        <h5>Other Problems include:</h5>
        <p>
It’s also important to note that if your car won’t start, the battery may not be the only culprit. Problems starting can also be an indicator of a bad starter or alternator.
Your starter is what actually cranks your engine. When a starter isn’t working properly, the engine may start with difficulty, or won’t start at all. Starter issues may stem from electrical or mechanical failure, or from it breaking down completely.
Additionally, your alternator is responsible for two important tasks involved in powering your vehicle. First, it recharges your battery while your car is running, and second, it also works with your battery to operate integral electrical components, such as headlights, windshield wipers, and more. A damaged alternator can cause erratic electrical functions or prevent your engine from running.
Normally if you have a bad alternator (versus a dead battery), your engine may still start, but will die quickly and often because your alternator is no longer maintaining a charge. If you aren’t sure what is causing your starting problems, we can help.
