            The stability, balance and smoothness of the car is what ensures a comfortable ride for you and your carâ€™s
            steering and suspension are what makes this possible. Steering and suspension are responsible for keeping
            your wheels firmly intact with the ground, and a major player in keeping your car from veering to one side
            on the road. At the first sign of trouble, if your vehicle is making clunking sounds when going over bumps
            or bouncing excessively, it's about time to bring your car into Mainland Auto shop for steering and
            suspension services.
        </p>
        <p>Maintaining your suspension system will help prevent uneven tire wear, bad wheel bearing, and even power
            steering troubles.
