      <p>  The functionality of our cars produces exhaust gasses which in turn necessitate for our cars to have an air filtration system because of the exhaust gases emitted from our cars and those around us while running. We can limit their impact on the environment and our health with a properly functioning exhaust and emission control system.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, automakers have developed sophisticated ways to increase efficiency, limit emissions and reduce noise. Your exhaust system includes your piping, muffler and a catalytic converter, which reduces pollution. Generally speaking, exhaust systems are resilient, and problems that arise with them are often a sign that something else in the vehicle isn’t working properly. Still, it’s important to be vigilant about possible exhaust problems.
</p>
<p>
Signs of the exhaust system problem include
<ul class="list_style_ul_children">
    <li>
-	Excessive loud noise</li>
<li>
-	Decrease in fuel efficiency</li>
<li>
-	Engine misfires</li>
<li>
-	Gasoline odors</li>
<li>
-	Decrease in acceleration or power</li>
</ul>
Rust and corrosion are the biggest enemies to your exhaust system.</p>
