            Your vehicle’s ability to properly heat and cool your car is central to your comfort and the comfort of your
            passengers. Without the heating and air conditioning systems in today’s modern vehicles, we would all be
            miserable driving to our destinations. Our professional technicians are capable to diagnose and repair many
            components in your cooling system including the water pump, radiator, belts, thermostat and more.
        </p>
        <p>At Mainland Auto-shop, we offer a cooling system test procedure designed to pinpoint any issues that may
            exist within this complex system and provide solutions.
