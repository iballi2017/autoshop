       <p>One of the downsides to buying a used car, however, is not knowing its history in detail and if proper preventive maintenance has been taken. We at Mainland Auto shop are experienced in conducting a pre-purchase vehicle inspection for a car without warranty to avert any financial risk. Spotting the problems before you purchase the vehicle can save you a lot of money. You can use any problems you find to negotiate a better price for the vehicle, and if theyâ€™re too costly or make the vehicle unsafe, you can avoid buying it altogether and find something safer for you.
