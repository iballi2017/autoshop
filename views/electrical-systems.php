            Your car is controlled by a complex network of wires, sensors, and computers working together and most mechanical functions nowadays depend on electrical components. If communication along these wires is interrupted, it could have major consequences for several components of your car. Electrical systems are reliable yet more complicated than ever, and easier to diagnose and repair with the proper equipment.
